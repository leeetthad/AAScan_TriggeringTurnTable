# AA-Scan - Triggering Turn Table

The TriggeringTurnTable is a fork of the AA-Scan by QLRO that focuses on photogrammetry.

I added a thicker table for better stability and weight capacity, and sketched out an electronics setup that will allow you to trigger a camera after each move by the turn table.

There is currently a buzzer that will alert you when a full revolution has been completed, but I intend to also add the following:
- Pot to adjust the angle increment of rotation
- LED display for the the angle increment and/or the remaining time for the revolution


Original Description:

"AAScan: Open source, minimalist, fully automated 3D scanner based on Arduino and Android

This is the source code for the software used in AAScan. You can find details of assembly and use of it from the Thingiverse page: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4167615

This is an open source project. Suggestions are welcome!"
