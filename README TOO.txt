The TriggeringTurnTable is a fork of the AAScan 3D Scanning Turntable that focuses on photogrammetry.

I added a thicker table for better stability and weight capacity, and sketched out an electronics setup that will allow you to trigger a camera after each move by the turn table.

There is currently a buzzer that will alert you when a full revolution has been completed, but I intend to also add the following:
- Pot to adjust the angle increment of rotation
- LED display for the the angle increment and/or the remaining time for the revolution
